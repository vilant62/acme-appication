Background
================

The ACME company wants the candidate to deploy their new super duper web application to AWS
or Azure. The company employs some pretty interesting developers and they can on occasion play
russian roulette on the instances. The candidate should keep this in mind (Don't ask why they have
access to production).

Dependencies
-----

The application has no dependencies.

Problem 1
-----

Use any tool to be able to create a repeatable and predictable product deployment.
Restrictions
There are no restrictions and the candidate should see this as an opportunity to showcase their
ability to perform repeatable and predictable deployments to one of the cloud providers listed
(AWS/Azure).
Verification
The deployment can be verified by issuing a web request to http://{ip}:8080/success

Problem 2
----

The application has been updated and the candidate is required to deploy a new version of the
application and take into consideration that downtime should be minimized.
